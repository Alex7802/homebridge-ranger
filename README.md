# homebridge-ranger

A HomeKit range extender for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) accessories.

Bridges existing HomeKit BLE accessories to IP via [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) and makes them accessible even if they're out of range of your HomeKit Hub.

## Beware

**This plugin is in early development. While it has already been used in several situations, expect it to fail. Contributions are welcome to improve it.**

## Documentation

Please read the documentation in its entirety as this plugin is a bit more complex than your usual Homebridge plugin.
